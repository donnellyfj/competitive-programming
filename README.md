# Competitive Programming Practice
This is a collection of my competitive programming practice which I began during my time as an intern with [ICPC](https://icpc.global/). The problems are done on Codeforces and AtCoder, and they are grouped based on the collection of problems I was working on. You can find the problem names commented at the beginning of each file, and you can find problems themselves by doing a Google search for something like "Codeforces \<problem name\>". Folders starting with "abc" correspond to an AtCoder Beginner Contest. Most of the code here is in C++, since I wanted to get some practice/that's the language most commonly used for competitive programming. There are also some LeetCode problems, namely from the ["Blind 75"](https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/), which I completed predominantly using Python.

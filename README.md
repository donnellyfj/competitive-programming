# ICPC Internship
This is a collection of my competitive programming practice which I began during my time as an intern with ICPC. The problems are done on Codeforces, and they are grouped based on the collection of problems I was working on. You can find the problem names commented at the beginning of each file, and you can find problems themselves by doing a Google search for "Codeforces <problem name>". Most of the code here is in C++, since I wanted to get some practice/that's the language most commonly used for competitive programming.
